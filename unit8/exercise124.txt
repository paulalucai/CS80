The Chrome Developer Tools have been of use to me for years now, ever since I first downloaded Google Chrome. At that time, I believe it was around 2010, I became infatuated with Tumblr, and I dove deep into customizing the themes for my blog. Whenever I would come across another blog that featured some nice font or color scheme that I liked, I would just right-click the page and choose "Inspect Element" to find out more info and copy it into my theme code. I always felt like some sort of hacker spy, and to be honest I still do! I found it really useful to look at the code of other websites so that I could learn how to organize my own content according to the Box Model and such.

More recently, I've discovered many more facets to the DevTools that are interesting and practical. I've noticed that in the main code inspector, the script code on the page can change in real-time as the site updates. This seems to happen most often when Twitter is embedded to the website. I also found the Javascript console, which will run on the page any scripts you type into it. There's also what appears to be a network database table, which logs different types of HTTP requests and tells you whether they were processed successfully. The Chrome Developer Tools can do a lot more than just showcase the DOM and styling of the websites you visit.
